        <p>Welcome to my website!<br> My name is Russell, and I am an 8th Grade student. <br>My school is in Citra Kasih, and I am currently 14 years old.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of languages when it comes to coding. Either it be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>Python</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>C++</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>HTML</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript</a>. </p>
        <h3>I wanted to learn how to code because :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I wanted to try making a game.</li>
            <li>Curiosity got me here.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to do in my spare time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Throughout my coding lessons, I've learned quite a lot of languages. They include :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
        </ol>
