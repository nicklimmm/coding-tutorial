        The Griffin is a mythical creature known as a half-eagle, half-lion in
        various cultures. In legends and folklore, the beast guards the gold of
        the kings, as well as other priceless possessions. Moved into the far
        north, this ancient creature watches over the green gold inherent in the
        forests. Griffin also has counterparts in Finnish folklore and
        mythology. Depending on their name, Finnish griffins can either be
        spirits laying over treasures hidden underground or wizards' henchmen,
        taking the form of giant birds.
